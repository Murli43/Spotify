# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Spotify Data

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to explore and analyze Spotify data to gain insights into music trends, artist popularity, and track characteristics. Through visualizations and statistical summaries, we will uncover patterns in song popularity, duration, and artist rankings.

## 📂 Dataset Information

- Analyze track durations and their distribution
- Examine correlations between popularity and other features
- Visualize trends 
## 🔍 Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and duplicates
- Converted **Duration (ms)** to  seconds**
- Standardized feature names for consistency



## 🔗 Future Work
- Implement machine learning models to predict track popularity
